        Honda Quint Integra, available only at Honda's Japanese dealership sales channel Honda Verno before going on
        sale a year later in North America as part of the then-new luxury Acura lineup. The three-door hatchback was the
        only model available originally, with a five-door arriving in October 1985. The four-door saloon bodystyle
        became available in Japan in the autumn of 1986.[10] Only the hatchback versions were sold in the U.S. A 1.6 L
        DOHC 16-valve four-cylinder engine powered most versions. The engine was the vehicle's most publicized feature,
        as DOHC, multi-valve engines were not commonplace in entry-level models at the time.</div>
